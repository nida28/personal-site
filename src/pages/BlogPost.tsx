        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Building scalable React applications requires careful planning and adherence to best practices. In this post, we'll explore the key principles that will help you create maintainable and performant React applications.</p>
        
        <h2>Component Architecture</h2>
        <p>One of the most important aspects of scalable React applications is having a well-thought-out component architecture. This means creating reusable components, maintaining a clear separation of concerns, and following consistent naming conventions.</p>
        
        <h2>State Management</h2>
        <p>As your application grows, managing state becomes increasingly complex. Consider using tools like Redux, Zustand, or React Query to handle state management effectively.</p>
        
        <h2>Performance Optimization</h2>
        <p>Performance is crucial for user experience. Implement lazy loading, memoization, and proper code splitting to ensure your application remains fast as it scales.</p>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Building scalable React applications is an ongoing process that requires attention to architecture, performance, and maintainability. By following these best practices, you'll be well on your way to creating applications that can grow with your needs.</p>

        <h2>What is Clean Code?</h2>
        <p>Clean code is code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain. It follows consistent patterns and naming conventions, making it accessible to other developers (and your future self).</p>
        
        <h2>Key Principles</h2>
        <p>The foundation of clean code rests on several key principles: meaningful names, small functions, clear comments, and consistent formatting.</p>
        
        <h2>Practical Examples</h2>
        <p>Let's look at some practical examples of how to transform messy code into clean, readable code that communicates its intent clearly.</p>
        
        <h2>Benefits</h2>
        <p>Writing clean code pays dividends in the long run. It reduces bugs, speeds up development, and makes collaboration much more enjoyable.</p>

        <h2>CSS Grid and Flexbox</h2>
        <p>Modern CSS layout techniques like Grid and Flexbox have revolutionized how we approach web layouts. These tools provide powerful and flexible ways to create responsive designs.</p>
        
        <h2>Custom Properties</h2>
        <p>CSS custom properties (variables) allow for more maintainable and dynamic stylesheets. They're particularly useful for theming and creating consistent design systems.</p>
        
        <h2>Container Queries</h2>
        <p>Container queries represent the next evolution in responsive design, allowing components to respond to their container's size rather than just the viewport.</p>
        
        <h2>Future of CSS</h2>
        <p>The future of CSS is bright, with new features like subgrid, cascade layers, and improved color functions making development more powerful and enjoyable.</p>
