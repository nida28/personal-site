Time and time again, as an immigrant in Germany, I have found myself googling my rights — around tenancy, employment, and more. Each time, I kept running into dense legal paragraphs, cryptic citations, and explanations clearly written for experts — not for everyday people, and definitely not for non-native speakers.

Google Translate could only take me so far. What I really needed wasn’t just a translation — it was context. Something that broke things down, added clarity, and helped me actually understand what the law meant for me.

After a lot of searching, I couldn’t find any free tools that did what I needed — so I decided to build one myself. That’s how the BGB ChatBot came to life.

## What I Built (and Why)

The BGB ChatBot is a legal Q&A assistant built on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It helps users understand German civil law in plain English — with real sources to back it up.

What it does:
- Answers questions about tenancy, employment, family law, and more
- Links directly to the relevant paragraph in the BGB
- Focuses on factual information — not legal interpretation
- Not a lawyer, just a guide
---

Below is a breakdown of how I built the BGB Bot.

### Step 1: Laying the Foundation

I started with the official ENglish HTML version of the Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch (BGB). It was structured... inconsistently. Some sections had clear anchors like `p0069`, others relied on `<br>` tags.

I wrote a custom C# parser to:

- Detect and extract legal sections
- Group subparagraphs under the right heading
- Preserve the hierarchy of the law (sections → subsections → clauses)

### Step 2: Embed the Text

Each chunk of legal text was:

- Split based on length and semantic boundaries
- Embedded using OpenAI’s `text-embedding-3-small`
- Stored with metadata like `section: §573c`

These embeddings power semantic search using cosine similarity — comparing the meaning of the user’s query to the legal chunks.

## Step 3: Querying the Law

When someone asks something like:

> Can my landlord terminate my lease mid-contract?

The bot:

1. Embeds the question
2. Searches for the most relevant chunks
3. Builds a prompt that includes:
   - Retrieved legal content
   - The original user query
   - A system instruction to stay factual and say “I don’t know” when unsure
4. Sends the prompt to an LLM to generate a grounded answer

Each answer links to:

- A static page I built for that legal paragraph
- The official BGB site (in English and German)

---

## Why RAG?

Traditional LLMs are powerful — but they guess. Sometimes very convincingly.

They:

- Make up fake laws
- Don’t know your local legal context
- Can’t cite real sources

By grounding the model with real data (RAG), I was able to guide it toward accurate, useful responses based on real law — not assumptions.

---

## What’s Next

In part two of the project, I’m exploring ways to keep the chatbot’s knowledge fresh:

- Setting up a web crawler to pull from government and legal websites (e.g., BMAS)
- Scheduling regular updates with AWS Lambda or Cloud Functions
- Using diffing logic to detect when content changes
- Figuring out whether to version the law or overwrite old data

The idea is to go from a static bot to a living, evolving system that stays up-to-date with legal developments.

---

## Challenges Along the Way

- Parsing HTML was messy. Legal websites aren’t built for devs.
- Chunking had to be careful — too much or too little ruins relevance.
- Prompt tuning took trial and error.
- I’m still figuring out how best to host the embeddings.

## Why This Matters

I built this tool because I believe legal information should be easier to understand — especially for people navigating systems in a new country.

I’m still learning and experimenting, but I hope this helps someone feel a little less lost in the fine print.
