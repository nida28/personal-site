# Welcome to MDX

This is a sample post that demonstrates MDX capabilities. You can write regular markdown and also use React components.

## Code Example

```typescript
const greeting = (name: string) => {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
};

console.log(greeting("Developer"));
```

## Lists and Links

Here are some features of MDX:

- Write markdown as usual
- Import and use React components
- Style with Tailwind
- [Learn more about MDX](https://mdxjs.com)

> MDX allows you to use JSX in your markdown content. It's the best of both worlds!

## Custom Components

You can even use custom components in your MDX files:

{/* Example of using a custom component */}
{/* <CodeDemo language="javascript">
console.log("This is a custom component!");
</CodeDemo> */}

## Images

You can include images in your posts:
